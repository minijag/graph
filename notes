notes

removed <tbody> from line 8 because it isn't needed
added <h2> to line 12 because there was a closing </h2>
removed <h3> from line 11 because, I feel bigger is better for headers

added <ol> and <li> above line 62 to keep consistency with part one
added </li> to line 73 to close the <li> i added

added </th> to close the <th>'s on lines 18, 19, 20, 21
added </td>'s to close all the data entries
added </li> to line 69 to close it
added id's to all rows for table to be able to find them

added comments to when columns begin and ends to keept track of doms at glance on lines 9, 77, 78, 84

I did not remove extra punctuation inside the chart, because I didn't want to assume companies names were spelled wrong.

I made my own graph using svg because it was a little more challenging.
There are a lot of great graphing and chart libraries out there that are much more aesthetically pleasing.
